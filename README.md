# Horiseon Web Services

## Description
This webpage was built to provide potential clients with information regarding the services and benefits that Horiseon provides. It helps the user make informed decisions about the services they wish to procure. 

This project taught me to read, alter, and optimize messy code, and to make meaningful changes to improve the accessibility of the program.
